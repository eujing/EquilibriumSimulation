Equilibrium Simulation
======================

A chemistry project to demonstrate a reaction going to equilibrium, as well as the various factors that can affect the equilibrium. This is basically a 2D collision simulator with some elements of chemistry.

Molecules are modelled as circles and stored in quadtrees for efficient collision detection. Changes in the dynamic parameters affect the physical properties of each molecule only (approximations).

Parameters
----------

Concentration (number) of each molecule can be set before running the simulation, but cannot be changed during.

Dynamic parameters:
 - Enthalpy change of reaction
 - Activation energy of reaction
 - Temperature of system

Results (Trends)
----------------
The graphs visualize certain values of the reaction as it is happening. The yellow lines indicate the moving average of the particular value.
Changes in the dynamic parameters should roughly be reflected in the graphs, and is an approximation of what would actually happen.
 - Q: reaction quotient
 - t: time
 - species concentration: number of molecules corresponding to each species
